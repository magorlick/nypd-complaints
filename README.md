# New York Police Department Complaints

This directory contains an exploration of [NYC Open Data](https://zenodo.org/record/3902827#.Y5Sji-zMI0Q). 

## Getting started
Make sure that you have installed Rill Developer.

```
curl -s https://cdn.rilldata.com/install.sh | bash

```
For more information, see [docs.rilldata.com](https://docs.rilldata.com).


Run the following commands to clone the repository and start Rill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magorlick/nypd-complaints.git
cd nypd-complaints
rill start
```

The initial call to `rill start` may take a while depending on your network connection as it downloads some large remote CSV files.
